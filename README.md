# Code-Test



This is a quick quiz to test your early coding knowledge.  
The app stores the question data and shows it as needed.  
The same is done with the answer buttons, initial form & scoreboard.  
The scoreboard stores the initials and score associated with a particular run.  
There is also a function to clear the scoreboard or restart the quiz mapped to buttons.  

Here's a link to the exam:
